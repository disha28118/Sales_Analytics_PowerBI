- Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the company's sales data. The dashboard provides a 360° view of sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, channel performance, and regional distribution.
By integrating data from orders, customers, products, and regions, stakeholders can explore key business metrics and identify patterns that drive decision-making.
The analysis helps answer critical questions:
Which products generate the most revenue?
Who are the most valuable customers?
Which sales channels perform best?
How do sales vary by region and currency?
What is the impact of cost and pricing on profitability?

- Problem Statement
The company’s raw sales data is scattered across different files and formats, making it difficult to analyze and interpret effectively.
Without a consolidated and interactive reporting solution, decision-makers struggle to:
Identify sales trends and seasonality.
Recognize high-value customers.
Evaluate warehouse and shipping efficiency.
Measure the impact of currency fluctuations on sales.
Detect low-performing products that may require strategic changes.
This lack of consolidated analysis hinders timely decision-making and affects overall sales strategy and profitability.

- Objectives
The goal of the Sales Analytics Dashboard is to:
Sales Overview – Display total sales, total orders, profit, and average unit price.
Trend Analysis – Track sales trends over time to detect seasonal patterns.
Customer Insights – Identify top customers by revenue and order count.
Channel Performance – Compare sales across online, wholesale, distributor, and export channels.
Currency Impact – Analyze sales in different currencies and their effect on revenue.
Warehouse Performance – Monitor order fulfillment and shipping delays.
Product Performance – Highlight top and bottom-performing products.
Profitability Analysis – Compare revenue, cost, and profit margins.
Regional Sales – Visualize sales by delivery region.

- Key insights from the analysis
Sales Seasonality – Revenue peaks during certain months, suggesting strong seasonal demand.
Top Customers Drive Revenue – A small percentage of customers contribute disproportionately to sales.
Channel Disparity – Wholesale and online sales generate the highest revenue, while export sales have lower volume but higher average prices.
Currency Dependence – Sales in USD and NZD dominate; currency fluctuations can impact profitability.
Product Performance Gaps – A few products account for most sales, while several underperform and may require promotion or discontinuation.
Regional Strengths – Certain regions consistently outperform others, indicating where marketing efforts should be concentrated.
Warehouse Delays – Some warehouses have longer fulfillment times, affecting delivery performance.
